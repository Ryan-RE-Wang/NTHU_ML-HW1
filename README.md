NTHU course 'Introduction to Machine Learning'  hold by professor 郭柏志(KUO, PO-CHIH)


In this assignment we are going to build a machine learning model to predict the future 7 days of COIVD-19 new cases of each country.

Our data is from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control which will update at 8pm everyday.

My method is use LInear Regression model to predict next 7 days new COVID-19 cases, and I adopted log transformation for data preprocessing.
